"Mupunga une dovi" means "rice with peanut butter" and is a common dish in Zimbabwe. I used it here to make "torpedos," so named because the leek makes a stinging sensation if you eat too many of these, like eating wasabi.

## Ingredients

- Brown rice
- Peanut butter
- Leek
- Bananas
- Baby carrots
- Raisins
- Cinnamon
- Cardamon
- Canola oil

## Directions

1. Rinse the rice and boil it uncovered until all the water is evaporated. Add the cinnamon and cardomon about halfway through.
2. Heat a pan and add oil once hot.
3. Slice the carrots into quarters length-wise and saute.
4. Slice the bananas.
5. Once small black or brown spots start to appear on the carrots, add the bananas.
6. Once the bananas form a caramel-like coating, take the bananas and carrots off the stove.
7. Once the water has evaporated, move rice to a small bowl and mix with peanut butter.
8. Slice the white bottom of the leek away and put it in the fridge for another day.
9. Separate the green part of the leek into individual leaves.
10. Fill the leaves with the bananas, baby carrots, and raisins.
11. Serve as a side dish, giving one or two torpedos per person.
