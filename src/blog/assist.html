btitle(`How to Win a Hackathon with Machine Learning', `2018 February 25')

<p>Last weekend, I won the Google Data Science award, the John Snow Labs award,
and the HopHacks 3<sup>rd</sup> overall best award for ASSIST, an AI which
predicts a stroke patients' chance of survival. I made it with

and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrick-wilson-duncan-5ab07053/">Derrick Wilson-Duncan</a>.
</p>

<p>To win the hackathon, we had to find stroke patient data, create a model
which used the data, and make it easy to use. Because this was a medical
project, I did not understand all the medical symptoms and techniques in the
data, so my premed friend Bill Zhang read the medical literature to find out.
My other friends, Edward and Derrick, made the client software, which was
fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>I'll focus on how I created the AI after finding the data and what you can
learn.</p>

<p>First off, don't worry too much about what programming language you use. I
used Python 3 because I am most familiar with it, but you may not want to use
Python 3. For example, game developers who have worked with Lua may want to use
Lua's Torch package for machine learning. In general, avoid using a verbose
language like Java or C++ to save your limited time, and avoid languages with
slow implementations like Ruby because they will be too slow to train the
model. Keep in mine that some of my tips may not apply to non-Python-3
developers.</p>

<p>First off, I recommend using Keras, which makes creating the model incredibly
simple. For reference, here is the code which declares the model's architecture:
</p>
<code class="prettyprint lang-py">from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from keras.utils import np_utils

model = Sequential([
	Dense(30, input_dim=15, activation='sigmoid'),
	Dense(30, activation='sigmoid'),
	Dense(1)
])
</code>
<br />

<p>In total, my code which powers the AI was about 200 lines of code. You can
find it <a href="https://github.com/AbhinavMadahar/ASSIST/tree/master/src">here</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from using Keras, make sure that you don't overtrain your model by
getting plenty of data. For example, I extended my data by slightly adjusting
patient data, such as age or symptoms, so that I can get more data without
losing validity. Using this, I extended from 20k to 100k data points.<p>

<p>Finally, make sure that your architecture is reasonable for your problem. I
constantly see people try to use absurdly complex models purely for the
buzzwords when a simpler model would be just as effective and must faster to
train.</p>
