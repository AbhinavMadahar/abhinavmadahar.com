## Ingredients

- Bread
- Hummus
- 1 bell pepper
- $\frac{1}{2}$ white onion
- 2 white mushrooms
- Canola oil
- Olive oil

## Directions

1. Wash the bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms.
2. Cut out the core of the bell pepper by cutting a circle around the top,
   making sure the knife goes down to the bottom of the pepper.
3. Cut open the bell pepper and throw away the core.
4. Cut the bell pepper into thin slices.
5. Cut the onion into slices [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coxVzC4tcYw).
6. Chop up the mushrooms into 1 cm<sup>3</sup>-sized cubes.
6. Turn on the stove to medium heat and wait for a few minutes while the pan
   heats up.
7. Add a tablespoon or two of canola oil to coat the pan in a thin layer of
   oil.
8. Put the pepper slices on the pan, mixing them around every minute. They are
   finished cooking when they have black spots. You may think that you're
   burning them, but keep cooking anyway. Once they're done cooking, remove
   from the pan and set aside.
9. Put the onions on the pan and cook until they're golden brown. Then set
   aside.
10. Cook the mushrooms on the pan until they're brown, and then set aside.
11. Put a bit of olive oil on both sides of the bread, and then toast it on the
	pan. Remove when it's done cooking.
12. Spread the hummus on the toasted bread, and then add the other vegetables.
