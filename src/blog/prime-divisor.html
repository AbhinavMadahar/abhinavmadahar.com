btitle(`The Greatest Divisor of $p^2-1$ for Primes $p > 3$', `2018 January 23')

<p>This was a problem from the Rutgers Undergraduate Mathematics competition in
2017:

<blockquote>
	Find the greatest natural $n$ which divides all $p^2-1$ for primes $p>3$
</blockquote></p>

<p>And here is my solution, made with the help of Albert Lee and Tom
O'Shaughnessy.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Proof: </em>first, we note that, because $5$ is a prime greater than $3$,
then $n$ must divide $5^2-1=24$, so $1 \leq n \leq 24$.</p>

<p>Next, we note that $p^2-1=(p-1)(p+1),$ so we make a number line centered at
$p$:</p>
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
p-2& p-1 & p & p+1 \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

<p>We note that $p$ cannot be divisible by $2$ because it's a prime greater
than $2$, so $p$ must be odd, so $p+1$ and $p-1$ are both be divisible by $2.$
Trivially, exactly $1$ of $3$ consecutive naturals (e.g. $p-1, p , p+1$)
must be divisible by $3$, and we know that a prime $p>3$ isn't divisible by
$3$, so exactly one of $p-1$ and $p+1$ is divisble by $3$. Now, we note that
exactly $1$ of $4$ naturals must be divisible by $4$, so one of $p-2, p-1, p,
p+1$ must be divisible by $4$. However, $p$ and $p-2$ are both odd, so they
can't be divisible by $4$, so exactly one of $p-1$ and $p+1$ is divisible by
$4$.</p>

<p>Now, we've established that, among $p-1$ and $p+1$, both are divisible by
$2$, exactly one is divisible by $3$, and exactly one is divisible by $4$.
Thus, $(p-1)(p+1) = p^2-1$ must be divisible by $2$ twice, $3$ once, and $4$
once, so it's divisible by $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24$. This is true for any
prime $p>3$. We've already established that $n \leq 24$, so now that we've
established that $24$ divides $p^2-1$ for all primes $p>3$, we've proven
that the greatest such $n$ is $24$. $\blacksquare$ </p>

<hr />

As a closing remark, note that the same argument could be made using
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
p-1 & p & p+1 & p+2 \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$
by replacing every $p-2$ with $p+2$ in the proof.
