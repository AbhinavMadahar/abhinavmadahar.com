  <h1>Greatest Natural Which Divides All Primes > 3</h1>
  <p>I am an undergraduate mathematics student at Rutgers, and I intend to participate in its <a href="http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~prize/">competition for undergrads</a>.
  In preparation and for fun, I worked on the first problem of their 2017 problem set with my friend Albert Lee.</p>

  <blockquote>Find the greatest number $n$ that divides $p^2 - 1$ for all primes $p > 3$.</blockquote>

  <p>Of course, this is a discrete mathematics competition, so the goal is a rigourous proof, not just the particular number.</p>

  <p>First, I like to estabish types and notation. I will interpret that $n$ is a natural number. <br />
  Also, $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of all primes, $\mathbb{P}_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ prime such that $\mathbb{P}_{1} = 2$, and $\mathbb{P}_{>k}$ is all the primes greater than $k$. $\mathbb{P}_{\ge{} k}$ is defined similarly.</p>

  <p>Now, observe that such an $n$ must exist.
  If a natural $k$ is odd, then $2$ is not a prime factor of $k$, so $2$ must also not be a prime factor of $k^2$, which has the same unique prime factors as $k$.
  All of the primes $p > 3$ are odd because the only even prime is $2$, and $2 \le 3$. If $p^2$ is odd, then $p^2-1$ is even, so it is divided by $2$.
  Thus, if $n=2$ then $n$ divides $p^2 - 1$ for all primes $p > 3$, though it not necessarily the largest such $n$.</p>

  <p>Our goal is now to find the largest such $n$.</p>
