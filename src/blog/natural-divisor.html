  <h1>Greatest Natural Which Divides All Primes > 3</h1>
  <p>I am an undergraduate mathematics student at Rutgers, and I intend to participate in its <a href="http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~prize/">competition for undergrads</a>.
  In preparation and for fun, I worked on the first problem of their 2017 problem set with my friend Albert Lee.</p>

  <blockquote>Find the greatest number $n$ that divides $p^2 - 1$ for all primes $p > 3$.</blockquote>

  <p>Of course, this is a discrete mathematics competition, so the goal is a rigourous proof, not just the particular number.</p>

  <p>First, I like to estabish types and notation. I will interpret that $n$ is a natural number. <br />
  Also, $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of all primes, $\mathbb{P}_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ prime with 1-indexing, and $\mathbb{P}_{>k}$ is all the primes greater than $k$. $\mathbb{P}_{\ge{} k}$ is
  defined similarly.</p>
