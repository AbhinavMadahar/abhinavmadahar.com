  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

  <p>Hello, this is my discrete mathematics blog. I will
  add some posts giving proofs of interesting theorems
  I have made, but I must first set up MathJAX and a few
  other important components.</p>

  <p>However, rest assured that the blog is already surprisingly
  complicated in its built setup, which uses a Makefile and
  a really nasty Perl script, both of which will likely be improved
  upon or wholly replaced soon.</p>
