<h2>Hello, world!</h2>

<p>Hello, this is my discrete mathematics blog. I will
add some posts giving proofs of interesting theorems
I have made, but I must first set up MathJAX and a few
other important components.</p>

<p>However, rest assured that the blog is already surprisingly
complicated in its built setup, which uses a Makefile and
a really nasty Perl script, both of which will likely be improved
upon or wholly replaced soon.</p>
