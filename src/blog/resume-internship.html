btitle(Writing a Resume to Get an Internship, 2018 April 11)

<p>This summer, I'm going to intern at Johnson &amp; Johnson as a medical
devices data scientist. I'm also a freshman who has never been able to get a
job before in his life, so I know the difference between a good resume and a
bad one. Let's examine the major mistakes university students make when writing
their resumes, from my experience.</p>

<p>As I detailed in my <a href="/blog/writing.html">last post about writing,</a>
you have to think from the perspective of your reader when you write. For a
resume, you have to think from the perspective of an employer. You have to
convince employers that they need <em>you</em> on their team and nobody else
could possibly compare. You resume is an argument for your employment.</p>

<br />

<h2>Mistake 1: Random Junk in Your Resume</h2>

<p>If I wanted to employ a computer programmer, I would care about their:</p>
<ul>
	<li>prior work experience in computer programming/computer science/etc.</li>
	<li>personal projects</li>
	<li>education in computer science</li>
</ul>
<p>and so forth, so put that stuff on your resume if you want to be a programmer.
I would not care about their favourite TV show, their high school GPA, etc., so
please don't put that stuff on your resume. If you had a 3.8 GPA in high school
and love to play the guitar, then why would that make you a good programmer? In
towards your bachelor's; we know you went to high school.</p>


<br />

<h2>Mistake 2: Poor Formatting</h2>

<p>Your resume is not an assigned reading for a course. If someone can't easily
read it, then they'll just throw it out and read someone else's. For example,
consider <a href="#resume">my resume.</a></p> You can immediately identify a
few things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it's a resume</li>
	<li>it's my resume</li>
	<li>I have relevant experience and have won awards</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot immediately identify this within a few seconds, then your
resume is broken. Make sure to use formatting properly.</p>
