title: Apple and Coconut Tofu
date: 2018 May 15

## Ingredients:

1. **Extra firm tofu**, half of a slab
2. **McIntosh Apple**, 1 apple
3. **Coconut oil**, a teaspoon
4. **Soy sauce**, 5 drops
5. **Paprika**, half-teaspoon

## Preparation:

1. **Chop up the tofu into small cubes**. This makes them faster to cook and eat.
   To do so, I prefer to cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then cut each half in half, etc., until I can no longer cut them further. That way, I have several thin sheets of tofu. Then I turn the tofu and cut along another axis, repeating as before. Finally, I cut in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and final direction to finish making the cubes.
2. **Put the tofu and coconut oil into a pan and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes**. Mix the tofu every 30 seconds to prevent it from burning and sticking to the pan.
3. **Chop the apple** into pieces almost as small as the tofu pieces.
4. **Pour the tofu into a bowl and mix in apple pieces, the soy sauce, and the paprika.**
