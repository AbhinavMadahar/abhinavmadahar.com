btitle(`4:44 and Flower Boy', 2018 March 2)

<p>I've been thinking a lot about how Jay-Z's <i>4:44</i> and Tyler, the
Creator's <i>Flower Boy</i> seem like they're written by the same man at
different ages.</p>

<p>Anthony Fantano said that <i>4:44</i> is "grown-man rap," and Pitchfork said
that one if <i>Flower Boy</i>'s defining atributes is "navigating youthful
ennui".
