<p>Modern mathematics is almost universally<a href="#lambda-category">*</a>
based on set theory, so I decided to read Pinter's <i>Set Theory</i>.</p>

<p>Naive set theory says that a set is any collection of objects. For example,
the set of natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, is the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$.
Naive set theory runs into several problems, so most mathematicians use
Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, so this post also uses it. The difference is
not important for this post.</p>

<p>The intersection $A \cap B$ of 2 sets, $A$ and $B$, is the set of objects which
are in both $A$ and $B$. For example,
$$\{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{2, 3, 4\} = \{2, 3\}$$

Note that the associative property holds for $\cap$. Also,
	$$\bigcap_{i \in I}^{} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n$$
</p>
Here is a proof of an exercise in <i>Set Theory</i>.

<hr />
<strong>Conjecture</strong>
<p>Let $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family of
sets. Prove that
	$$\bigcap_{i \in I}^{} A_i$$
is a set.</p>

<strong>Proof</strong>
<p>By definition, the intersection of 2 sets is a set. The associative property
holds for the intersection, so
	$$\bigcap_{i \in I}^{} A_i = A_1 \cap (A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n)$$
We already know that $A_1$ is a set, so $\bigcap_{i \in I}^{} A_i$ is a set
if $(A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n)$ is a set. We can repeat this step, writing that
	$$A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n = A_2 \cap (A_3 \cap \ldots A_n)$$
Again, we see that $A_2$ is a set, so we now need to prove $A_3 \cap \ldots A_n$
is a set. We repeat this step until we get
	$$A_{n-1} \cap (A_n)$$
which is a set, so now we go backwards, seeing that
	$$A_{n-2} \cap (A_{n-1} \cap A_n)$$
is a set, and continuing backwards until we prove that
	$$A_1 \cap (A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n)$$
is a set, which equals
	$$\bigcap_{i \in I}^{} A_i$$
Thus, $\bigcap_{i \in I}^{} A_i$ is a set. QED

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
	<li id="lambda-category">Aside from set theory, there are several other
		useful foundations for mathematics, such as lambda calculus and category
		theory.  Lambda calculus is very popular in computer science in particular,
		where it is the inspiration for functional programming using languages such
		as Haskell.  Category theory is also really interesting because it's just
		so abstract that even mathematicians (jokingly) call it <a

			nonsense</a>.</li>
