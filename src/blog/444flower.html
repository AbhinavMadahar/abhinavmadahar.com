btitle(`4:44 and Flower Boy', 2018 March 2)

<p>Anthony Fantano said that <i>4:44</i> is "grown-man rap," and Pitchfork said
that one of <i>Flower Boy</i>'s defining attributes is "navigating youthful
ennui". After listening to both, I get the sense that these 2 albums feel like
they are written by the same man. Through Tyler, we explore this man's
struggles as a youth adjusting to fame and trying to reconcile his desire for
companionship, both romantic and platonic, with his desire for fame and
fortune. Through Jay-Z, we explore this man many decades later, as a father and
successful businessman looking back on his life, feeling both proud of some
accomplishments and regretful of others.</p>
