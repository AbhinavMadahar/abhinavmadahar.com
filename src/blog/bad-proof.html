btitle(Why this proof is bad, 2018 April 24)

<p>In my <i>Intro to Mathematical Reasoning</i> course, I had to prove that the
set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable. Although I was able to
easily do so, I now don't like my proof. Of course, I've already submitted my
homework, so I can't change it, but I can at least address my problems with it
here.</p>

<p>Here is my proof. Note that Corollary 1 states that the primes are
countable.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><b>Proposition 9.</b> <i>The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ is
		countable.</i></p>

	<p><i>Proof.</i> Let S be the infinite set of all finite subsets of
	$\mathbb{N}$. We construct a bijection $h : S \rightarrow (S_0 \subseteq
	\mathbb{N})$.</p>

	<p>Let $T \in S$. From Corollary 1, we know that there exists a bijection $f:
	\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$. We note that the image $f (T)$ is is a
	set of primes. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that there
	exists a bijection $g$ which maps finite sets of primes to naturals whose
	prime factorizations do not repeat primes. We see that $f(T)$ is in the
	domain of $g$. </p>

	<p>Thus, the function $h = g \circ f$ is a bijection, so $S$ is countable.
	$\square$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have difficulty understanding the proof, then there's nothing wrong
with you. Although this proof is valid and rigourous, it's just so abstract
that it's unnecessarily hard to understand.</p>

<p>Specifically, I don't give an explicit definition of $f$ nor $g$. I just say
that such bijections exist, which is all that I needed to do. However, in doing
so, I make the proof far too abstract. We will define $f$ and $g$ here.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><b>Definition.</b> Let $P \in \mathscr{P}(\mathbb{P})$ be finite. Then we
	let $g$ be a function whose domain is the finite subset of
	$\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{P})$ and codomain is the set of all naturals which don't
	repeat prime factorizations. We define $g$ with
		$$g(P) = \prod_{p \in P} p$$
	and $g^{-1}$ gives the prime factors of a natural. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By restricting the codomain of $g$ to naturals which don't repeat prime
factors, we see that $g$ is a bijection.</p>

<p>Now we define $f$.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><b>Definition.</b> The function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$ maps
	$n$ to the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ prime. That is,
		$$f(1) = 2,$$
		$$f(2) = 3,$$
		$$f(3) = 5,$$
	etc.</p>

	For convenience, if $N \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we let $f(N)$ be the image of
	$N$ under $f$. This is essentially an abuse of notation.
</blockquote>

<p>This makes it possible to give a more "tangible" description of the proof.
Let $T \in S$. Then $f(T)$ is the image of $T$ under $f$, so it maps each
element $t \in T$ to the $t^{\mathrm{th}}$ prime. We see that $f(T)$ is a set
of primes, so $g(f(T))$ is the unique product of those primes. We see that $g \circ f$ is bijective because:
<ol>
	<li>the elements in $T$ are unique because it is a set,</li>
	<li>and the elements in $f(T)$ are unique because $f$ is injective,</li>
	<li>and the elements in $g(f(T))$ are unique because $g$ is injective.</li>
</ol>

Thus, $g \circ f$ is an injection, so we let $h = g \circ f$. From this, we can
show that $h$ is surjective because its codomain was restricted to its image,
the set of naturals which don't repeat prime factors.

Thus, $h$ is a bijection.
