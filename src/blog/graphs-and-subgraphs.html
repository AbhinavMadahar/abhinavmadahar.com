btitle(`Graphs and Subgraphs', `2018 January 12')

<p>In modern mathematics, there are two major subfields, algebra and
analysis, which <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~moorxu/">Moor Xu</a>
helpfully describes as
<blockquote>
	<strong>Algebra</strong> is the study of collections of objects (sets,
	groups, rings, fields, etc). In algebra, people care more about the
	structures of these collections and how these collections interact than
	about the objects themselves.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	This is in direct contrast with <strong>analysis</strong>, which primarily
	studies individual objects; for example, an analyst might study the
	smoothness of an individual function.
</blockquote>

<p>I like both, but my courses right now center around analysis, so I've
spent my winter break reading a few algebra texts, especially <i>Graph Theory
	with Applications</i> by Bondy &amp; Murty.<p>

<p>If you're a younger undergrad who enjoys mathematics, I highly recommend
going through the beginning, which is quite accessible. Here are some of my
proofs for the exercises in Chapter 1: Graphs and Subgraphs. I provide
background on definitions so that you don't have to know much about graph
theory to understand my proofs. Because this blog is written for younger
undergrads, I will emphasis intuition over rigour.</p>

<h2>1.1 Graphs and Simple Graphs</h2>
<h3>1.2.2</h3>
<p>This exercise is a pretty easy way to learn what a graph is.</p>
<p>A graph is a collection of vertices (points) and edges (lines) connecting
those points. We denote a graph with a capital letter (e.g. $G$). We denote
the set of its vertices $V(G)$ and the set of its edges $E(G)$. We use
the Greek nu ($\nu$) to denote the number of vertices in the graph, and we
use the Greek epsilon ($\epsilon$) to denote the number of edges. We say that
a graph $G$ is congruent to a graph $H$ if every vertex in $G$ can be mapped
by a bijection to a vertix in $H$, and the same for every edge; we denote
congruence with $G \cong H$.</p>
<p>
<em>Exercise</em><br />
(a) Show that if $G \cong H$, then $\nu (G) = \nu (H)$ and $\epsilon
(G) = \epsilon (H)$ <br />
(b) Give an example to show that the converse is false
</p>
<p>
<em>My solution</em><br />
(a) If $G \cong H$, then every vertex in $V(G)$ can be mapped with a
bijection to a vertex in $V(H)$ by the definition of graph congruence.
Thus, the number of elements in $V(G)$ is equal to the number of elements
in $V(H)$. It immediately follows that $\nu (G) = \nu (H)$. The same
argument applies for $\epsilon (G) = \epsilon (H)$. <br />

(b) Both $G$ and $H$ below have $4$ vertices and $3$ edges, but they are not
congruent.
