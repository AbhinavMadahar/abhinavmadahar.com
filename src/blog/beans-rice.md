btitle(Beans and Rice, 2018 June 11)

## Ingredients

1. **Black beans,** $\frac{3}{4}$ cup dried.
2. **White beans,** $\frac{3}{4}$ cup dried.
3. **Rice,** $\frac{1}{4}$ cup dried.
4. **Coconut oil,** 1 teaspoon
5. **Canola oil,** 1 tablespoon
6. **Vegetable boullion,** 1 teaspoon.
7. **Oregano or thyme**, 5 shakes of the shaker.

## Directions

1. **Soak the beans overnight** in a bowl of water. Make sure that the water line is about an inch above the beans.
2. **Cook in pressure cooker** by pouring the beans in it, filling it with just enough to water to completely cover the beans, and cooking on medium heat. Once the pressure cooker whistles, turn it down to the lowest heat for 10 minutes. 
3. **Pour cold water on pressure cooker.**
4. **Pour out beans and rinse** in cold water.
5. **Rinse rice in cold water.**
6. **Boil rice in a pot** with $\frac{3}{2}$ cups water on medium heat. Stop when all the water is absorbed by the rice, which makes it very soft, almost like sticky rice.
7. **Heat beans in a pan with the oils** until they're warm throughout. 
8. **Pour rice into pan with beans.**
9. **Mix remaining spices, herbs, seasonings, and sauces.**
