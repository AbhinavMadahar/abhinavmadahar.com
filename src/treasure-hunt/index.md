# Welcome!

---

This is the Rutgers University Treasure Hunt, currently under development by Abhinav Madahar.
It will encapsulate all 5 of Rutgers' New Brunswick campi, but it currently only supports Busch.

This is a game of exploration.
You will be tasked with exploring many, but not all, of the notable locations on your campus of choice.
Starting at the campus' student center, your first clue will be given.
Use that to determine the location of the next clue, and go to it, where you will be given your next clue.
As you finish different regions within the campus, you will be given badges.

Now, select a campus to play.
